# TZUCHI MUSEUM PANORAMA
I used the open-source Panorama framework to design the panoramic tour system for Tzu Chi's "Tracing the Origin of Great Love" museum.  

The system consists of three main files:  
1. **museum.html**: The core HTML structure.  
2. **config-museum.json**: Configures hotspots for scene transitions and displaying info content.  
3. **styles-museum.css**: Defines styles for rendering the display in the browser.  

You can view the demo at the following URL:
